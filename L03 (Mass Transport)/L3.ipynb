    "We will now turn to a topic that builds naturally from the law of mass action, which is enzyme kinematics. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions, meaning they speed up the reactions, without being consumed in the process. There are many different mechanisms for how an enzyme can achieve this, but we won't go into these details. Instead we want to look at a simplified and understandable model of how enzymes work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzymes generally work by somehow lowering the energy barrier of a chemical reaction. This can for example be achieved by binding to an intermediate state in the reaction. Recall now Arrhenius' law, which stated that the rate constant of a reaction could be written as\n",
    "$$k = Ae^{-E_{\\rm barrier}/k_{\\rm B}T}.$$\n",
    "This relation tells us that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the exponential of the activation energy. Thus, even a relatively small reduction in the energy barrier of a given reaction can cause a huge change in reaction speed. Because of this, enzymes are usually highly efficient and can speed up reactions by many orders of magnitude ($>10^7$ in some cases!). \n",

    "<img src=\"fig/activation_barrier_enzyme.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The drastic change in reaction speed due to enzymes is hugely important for cellular function. We can effectively have reacting systems in the cell that have a rate so slow that they are effectively stable, but as soon as a bit of enzyme is added, things start happening. In this sense, enzymes can be thought of as on-buttons for various processes in the cell that are lying in standby. An example of this is the energy carrier molecules ATP. These molecules carry a fair bit of chemical energy, and so will spontaneously dissociate and release energy. However, the rate of this dissociation is very slow, and so it takes a very long time for ATP to dissociate on its own. The cell can therefore produce ATP through metabolism and let it sit for a while, without fear of wasting energy. Molecular machines can now be equipped with enzymes that speed up the dissociation of ATP, harnessing some of the released energy in the process. These enzymatic machines are known as *ATPases*, and we will see some of examples of these later in the course.\n",

    "It is important to note that an enzyme can never change the net change in Gibb's energy in a reaction, and will therefore never be able to change the direction of a reaction. An enzyme cannot trigger a reaction that is not spontaneous on its own, it can just speed it up. The upside however, is that the enzyme molecules doesn't get used up in the reaction, and therefore even a small amount of enzyme is usually enough to trigger some process."

So we won't try to model *how* an enzyme works, but instead what it does.\n",

    "Another class of molecules are the enzyme *inhibitors*. These are molecules that reduce, or completely shut of, the activity of enzymes. There are different functional ways for inhibitors to work, but the simplest mechanism is simply binding to enzyme more readily than the actual substrate, but then not actually converting to anything. Thus the enzymes waste their binding time on the inhibitors rather than the substrate. Enzyme inhibition is another important tool in the cell for regulating behavior, and many drugs are enzyme inhibitors. An example of this is penicillin, which inhibits an enzyme bacteria need for cell wall synthesis, eventually killing the bacteria as it is unable to maintain its own cell wall.\n",

    "Extending the Michaelis-Menten model to include enzyme inhibitors is quite easy, we simply add the inhibitor as a new species $I$, and new reactions to the system where the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme. It then turns out we can make slightly different models, depending on where the inhibitor binds. These different models would behave differently in practice. When comparing to experiment, it turns out that the different models correspond to different inhibitors, and so in practice, different enzyme inhibitors are grouped into different classes. The figure below shows how the Michaelis-Menten model would be extended for each of these groups. \n",

While we won't go through all the algebra here, the model predictions we end up with agree well with experiment, and are often very useful in practice.\n",

Sodium and calcium transport through the membrane will want to push membrane potential up, while potassium transport will tend to pull it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the concentrations in the table, this seems reasonable. Sodium and calcium have large inwards concentration gradient pressures, these ions *want* to enter the cell, which raises the membrane potential. Because of this, we refer to sodium and calcium currents as **inward currents**. Likewise, potassium is much more abundant in the cell, and so has a large concentration gradient pressure to leave the cell, which lowers the potential. Potassium is therefore an **outward** current.\n",

    "## The Nernst Potential as a driving force\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cell membrane is permeable to an ion type, and the membrane potential is different to the Nernst potential of that ion type, there will be a net transport of ions through the membrane. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take Na$^+$ as an example, if the membrane has open sodium channels, ions of this type can move through the membrane. If $V=E_{\\rm Na}$, they have no desire to do so, but if $V \\neq E_{\\rm Na}$, there will be a net transport of sodium that tries to shift the membrane potential closer to the Nernst potential. This means that if $V < E_{\\rm Na}$, sodium will enter into the cell (influx), while if $V > E_{\\rm Na}$, sodium will tend to leave the cell, to shift the membrane potential downward (efflux). For this reason, the Nernst potential is also often called the *reversal potential*, because this is the potential at which a given flux of ions reverses its direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bigger the difference in the actual membrane potential, and the equilibrium Nernst potential, the stronger the current will be. We refer to the difference $(V - E_{\\rm Na})$ as the *driving force*. To find the actual current, we assume it to be Ohmic, meaning the magnitude of the current is directly proportional to the driving force\n",
    "$$I_{\\rm Na} = g_{\\rm Na} (V - E_{\\rm Na}).$$\n",
    "The proportionality factor is the *conductance*, $g_{\\rm Na}$, which is also species specific. The more open sodium channels there are in the membrane, the more ions can pass through per time, and the stronger the conductance and the stronger the current for a given driving force. The conductance is also the inverse of electrical resistance $g = 1/R$, so this is just a formulation of Ohm's law ($I = V/R$), but with the driving force being replaced by $V - E_{\\rm Na}$, as we are now looking at electrodiffusion, and not just electric forces.\n",

    "$$I_{\\rm tot} = I_{\\rm cap} + I_{\\rm Na}.$$\n",
    "Like for our voltage clamp example, we will argue that this total current in effect will be zero. This is because any current through the sodium channels will distribute across the membrane itself, effectively charging it, which is expressed as the capacitive current. If $I_{\\rm tot}$ was different from 0 there would be a net charge leaving the cell, which would not be sustainable over a longer time perspective, as charge separation requires large amounts of energy.\n",
